Simple J.S. Guessing Game about Female Supreme Court Justices 
This was the result of several attempts to create a simple but unique
guessing game. At one point I was going to have users guess the total
amount of Supreme Court Justice to date (The Answer: 125). I simplified
and articulated this idea to instead ask a user to name all the Female
Supreme Court Justices. Fellow Code fellow students Kate and Elliot
were incredible supporrive as I attempted to plan out this code. Huge
thanks is owed to Elliot who helped me correct my 'do while loop'.
Hopefully, this cheeky game will be informative and fun.
